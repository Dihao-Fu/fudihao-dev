## 🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates a manufacturing data intelligence platform similar to what Seagate uses for:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecasting equipment failures before they happen
- **Quality Analytics**: Monitoring product quality trends and identifying issues
- **Production Optimization**: Analyzing manufacturing efficiency and bottlenecks

## 🏗️ Architecture
Raw Sensor Data → Data Lake → ETL Processing → Data Warehouse → Analytics & ML → Visualization

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python, PySpark, Pandas, SQL
- **Data Storage**: MySQL (Data Warehouse), Parquet/CSV (Data Lake)
- **Analysis**: Complex SQL queries, Machine Learning models
- **Visualization**: ECharts, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Git, Docker (optional)

## 📊 Data Sources

This project uses:
1. **Generated Manufacturing Data** - Simulated production line data
2. **Sensor Readings** - Temperature, vibration, power usage from equipment
3. **Quality Test Results** - Pass/fail metrics with detailed measurements

## 🚀 Quick Start
